        Hello and welcome to our experiment. Please read this instruction set very carefully.
    <br>
    <br>
    You are about to take part in an experiment that involves decision-making. The amount you earn will depend on a combination of your own decisions, the decisions made by others, and chance.
    Please ensure that your mobile phones and other similar devices are turned off.
    Additionally, please refrain from speaking or attempting to communicate with other participants during the experiment.
    <br>
    The experiment will be conducted anonymously, meaning that you will not know with whom you
    are interacting.
    <br>
    <br>
    We will begin with a short instructional period. During this time, you will receive an overview of the main components of the experiment.
    If you have any questions, please raise your hand, and your question will be answered aloud for everyone to hear.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>We guarantee that all information we receive from you will be treated confidentially. The game is anonymous. Your answers will only be used for scientific purposes.
        <br>
    The project had been discussed in detail by the ethics committee of the University of Wuppertal, which voted positively for the innocuousness of the projected study.
