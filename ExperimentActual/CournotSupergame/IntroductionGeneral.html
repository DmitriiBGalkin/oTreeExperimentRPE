    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><b> Instructions </b></h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    Hello and welcome to our experiment. Please read this instruction set very carefully. The
    experiment will be conducted anonymously, meaning that you will not know with whom you
    are interacting.
    <br>
    <br>
    Please do not talk with other participants during the entire experiment; if at any point in time
    you require assistance, please raise your hand.
    <br>
    <br>
    Throughout this part of the experiment you will be asked to assume the role of the manager of a hypothetical firm and make decisions on behalf of the firm in the market environment.
    Your firm will be in a market with one other firm that would be managed by another participant. The details of the market environment would be provided on the next page.
    <br>
    <br>
    The decisions you and the participants you are matched with make will be the basis of your compensation. The details about compensation would be provided in the next pages.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>We guarantee that all information we receive from you will be treated confidentially. The game is anonymous. Your answers will only be used for scientific purposes.
        <br>
    The project had been discussed in detail by the ethics committee of the University of Wuppertal, which voted positively for the innocuousness of the projected study.
